The flow terminal type
[_IfcFireSuppressionTerminalType_]($element://{0BD53C38-1858-4565-873A-DF63E756203F})
defines commonly shared information for occurrences of fire suppression

  * common properties with shared property sets
  

  * common representations
  

  * common materials
  

  * common composition of elements
  

  * common ports
  

  
It is used to define a fire suppression terminal type specification indicating
the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that
product type. The

[_IfcRelDeclares_]($element://{2B5611F4-8815-497d-B43E-430F01D3B9F4}) and may
be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of
[_IfcFireSuppressionTerminalType_]($element://{0BD53C38-1858-4565-873A-DF63E756203F})
are represented by instances of
[_IfcFireSuppressionTerminal_]($element://{F11D62D2-00DC-4c76-9F5F-D9624270555E}).
