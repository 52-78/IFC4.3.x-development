IfcVibrationDamperTypeEnum.AXIAL_YIELD
======================================
A displacement dependent type damper in which the resistance force generated
is determined by the plastic strain amount utilizing the plastic deformation
of the steel material. The axial yield type is a damper that yields energy by
absorbing the steel material against deformation in the axial direction, that
is, in the direction of expansion and contraction.
