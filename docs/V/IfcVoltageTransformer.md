IfcVoltageTransformer
=====================
An instrument transformer in which the secondary voltage, in normal conditions
of use, is substantially proportional to the primary voltage and differs in
phase from it by an angle which is approximately zero for an appropriate
direction of the connections.(IEC 60050-321-03-01)
