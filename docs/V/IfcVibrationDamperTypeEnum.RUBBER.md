IfcVibrationDamperTypeEnum.RUBBER
=================================
The rubber mold is a damper that absorbs energy by utilizing deformation of
laminated rubber. The difference between the seismic isolation bearing and the
rubber type damper is whether or not to support the weight of the upper
structures. The rubber damper does not transmit the weight of the upper
structures to the sub structure.
