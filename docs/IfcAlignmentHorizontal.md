IfcAlignmentHorizontal
======================
The horizontal alignment is composed of geometric segments with the following
three geometry types:  

  

  * straight line
  

  * arc of a circle
  

  * transition curve
  

  
The horizontal alignment delivers the metric for the linear reference system
used to position the vertical alignment segments and the cant segments.  
  
The tolerance limits for lengthwise, crosswise and angle errors must be kept.
Otherwise the chain will not be deemed to be linked together. If no absolute
coordinates are known, the initial coordinates of the geometric elements are
entered as (0,0) or using less precise coordinates (graphical coordinates) in
the geodetic reference system. The type of geodetic reference system and/or
the map projection must be given. The measurement respectively the calculation
date must be stated.
