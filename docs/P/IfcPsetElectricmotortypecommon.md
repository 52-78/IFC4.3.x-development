IfcPsetElectricmotortypecommon
==============================
Defines a particular type of engine that is a machine for converting
electrical energy into mechanical energy. Note that in cases where a close
coupled or monobloc pump or close coupled fan is being driven by the motor,
the motor may itself be considered to be directly part of the pump or fan. In
this case , motor information may need to be specified directly at the pump or
fan and not througfh separate motor/motor connection entities. NOTE:
