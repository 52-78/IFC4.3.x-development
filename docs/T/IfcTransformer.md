IfcTransformer
==============
A transformer is an inductive stationary device that transfers electrical
energy from one circuit to another.  
  
_IfcTransformer_ is used to transform electric power; conversion of electric
signals for other purposes is handled at other entities: _IfcController_
converts arbitrary signals, _IfcAudioVisualAppliance_ converts signals for
audio or video streams, and _IfcCommunicationsAppliance_ converts signals for
data or other communications usage.
