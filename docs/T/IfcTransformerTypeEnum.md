| COMBINED    | A transformer that changes different quantities **** between circuits.                                                                                                                         |
| CURRENT     |                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| VOLTAGE     | A transformer that changes the voltage between circuits.                                                                                                                                       |
| RECTIFIER   | A transformer that converts from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).                                                                                                              |
| CHOPPER     | A chopper is an electronic power DC convertor without an intermediate AC link giving a variable output voltage by varying the periods of conduction and non-conduction in an adjustable ratio. |
| FREQUENCY   | A transformer that changes the frequency between circuits.                                                                                                                                     |
| INVERTER    | A transformer that converts from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC).                                                                                                              |
