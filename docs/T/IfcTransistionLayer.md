IfcTransistionLayer
===================
Layered structure : subgrade can be composed of several transition layer with
its own properties (such as geotextile and sandâ€¦).  
Various technical solutions and designs.  
The transition layer has two different functions:  
1\. it prevents the mixing of the foundation layer and the underlying layer
and ensures a pressure-free water flow.  
2\. it reduces the effects of a rigid substructure (bridges, groundwater
tanks, tunnels, etc.) on the ballast bed.
