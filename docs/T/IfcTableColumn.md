IfcTableColumn
==============
An _IfcTableColumn_ is a data structure that captures column information for
use in an _IfcTable_. Each instance defines the identifier, name, description,
and units of measure that are applicable to the columnar data associated with
the _IfcTableRow_ objects.  
  
The use of _IfcTableColumn_ supersedes the _IsHeading_ flag associated with
_IfcTableRow_.
