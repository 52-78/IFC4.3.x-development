IfcTrackEdge
============
A track edge is a linear object that connects exactly two track nodes. A track
edge is straightened, branch-free and has a geometry with a length derived
from it.  
The two relations 'from' and 'to' from track edge to track node must be
present. They determine the direction of definition or referencing of the
track edge.
