IfcTractionTransformer
======================
A stationary device with two or more windings, in order to transmit electrical
energy, converts the AC voltage and current of one system to the AC voltage
and current of another system at the same frequency by electromagnetic
induction.(GB 1094, IEC 60076)  
electric energy converter without moving parts that changes voltages and
currents associated with electric energy without change of frequency.(IEC
60050)
