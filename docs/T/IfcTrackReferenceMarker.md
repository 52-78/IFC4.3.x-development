IfcTrackReferenceMarker
=======================
Generally bolts which are firmly fixed to permanent components such as
foundations, platform edges or civil engineering structures. Their position
and elevation are known to the nearest mm (planar, x/y/z coordinates).  
Serve as a reference for inspecting or ensuring (e.g. by mechanical tamper)
the ideal location and elevation of the track panel and other installation
elements.  
Serve to hold technical measuring elements (e.g. prism mirrors)
