IfcTrackIsolationLayer
======================
Track isolation layer is a structure layer placed on top surface of track
bases. It may implement functions of damage repair of track superstructure
under special circumstances and coordinate temperature deformation.  
Track isolation layer shall only appear in ballastless track structures.
