IfcTopologyRepresentation
=========================
_IfcTopologyRepresentation_ represents the concept of a particular topological
representation of a product or a product component within a representation
context. This representation context does not need to be (but may be) a
geometric representation context. Several representation types for shape
representation are included as predefined types:  
  
  
  
  
**Vertex**  
| topological vertex  
representation (with or without assigned geometry)  
  
---|---  
  
  
**Edge**  
| topological edge  
representation (with or without assigned geometry)  
  
  
  
**Path**  
| topological path  
representation (with or without assigned geometry)  
  
  
  
**Face**  
| topological face  
representation (with or without assigned geometry)  
  
  
  
**Shell**  
| topological shell  
representation (with or without assigned geometry)  
  
  
  
**Undefined**  
| no constraints imposed  
  
  
  
  
  
The representation type is given as a string value at the inherited attribute
''_RepresentationType_''.
