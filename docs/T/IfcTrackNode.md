IfcTrackNode
============
A track node is a point object and represents a track branching (simple
points, symmetric points, ...) or a track end (track ends, open track ends):  

  

  * Branches are those points in the track network where trains have exactly two options for further travel.
  

  * Track ends are those points in the track network where the track physically ends or where the continuation is no longer to be mapped in the system.
