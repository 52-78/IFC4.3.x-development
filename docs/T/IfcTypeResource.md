IfcTypeResource
===============
_IfcTypeResource_ defines a specific (or type) definition of a resource.\S\ It
is used to define a resource specification (the specific resource, that is
common to all occurrences that are defined for that resource) and could act as
a resource template.  
  
An _IfcTypeResource_ may have a list of property sets attached. Values of
these properties are common to all occurrences of that resource type. The type
occurrence relationship is realized using the objectified relationship
_IfcRelDefinesByType_.  
  
Subtypes of _IfcTypeResource_ may be exchanged without being already assigned
to subtypes of _IfcResource_.
