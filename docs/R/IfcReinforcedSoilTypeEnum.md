| Attribute            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SURCHARGEPRELOADED   | A method that applies load to the foundation to discharge pore water, and the foundation is consolidated to improve the foundation strength. Unloading when the carrying capacity reaches the required level. |
| VERTICALLYDRAINED    | A method to set vertical drainage measures in the foundation, so that pore water in the soil is discharged and the foundation strength is improved.                                                           |
| DYNAMICALLYCOMPACTED | The method of using dynamic tamping machine to drop the heavy hammer freely from the high place, compacting the soil and quickly improving the bearing capacity of the foundation.                            |
| REPLACED             | Dig out the soft soil in a certain range below the foundation ground and then backfill the area with high strength, low compressibility and no corrosive materials.                                           |
| ROLLERCOMPACTED      | A kind of compacting method that adopts rolling machinery, repeated rolling and vibration to make foundation soil compacted, strength increased and compressibility decreased.                                |
| GROUTED              | A method of injecting some curable slurry into cracks or pores of a geotechnical foundation to improve its physical and mechanical properties.                                                                |
