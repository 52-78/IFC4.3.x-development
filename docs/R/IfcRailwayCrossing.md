IfcRailwayCrossing
==================
Railway crossing covering for roads (secured/unsecured).  
Superstructure type also possible with ballast.  
Covering can be driven on in the transverse direction.  
Usually used in public areas.  
Often entails changes to the stiffness of the superstructure/substructure.
