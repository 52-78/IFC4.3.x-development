| Attribute                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| TRACKSTRUCTURE           | A spatial structure element that contains track-related elements.                                                                                                                                                          |
| TRACKSTRUCTUREPART       | A track structure part refers to a segment of a track system. It usually has one of the following functions: plain-track, turnout-track, dilatation-track.                                                                 |
| LINESIDESTRUCTUREPART    | A railway line side structure part is a longitudinal decomposition of railway lineside structure in more managable volume for engineering purposes.                                                                        |
| DILATATIONSUPERSTRUCTURE | The dilatation superstructure is one specific type of the track structure. It does not contain any plain-track or turnout panel.                                                                                           |
| SUBSTRUCTURE             | A spatial structure part to group earthwork-related elements, usually from the ballast bed (included) downwards. In case of a Railway running onto a bridge, this part may coincide with the superstructure of the bridge. |
| PLAINTRACKSUPESTRUCTURE  | The plain-track superstructure is one specific type of the track structure. It does not contain any turnout panel or dilatation panel.                                                                                     |
| LINESIDESTRUCTURE        | A spatial structure element that contains the elements of the railway that are not in or over the tracks, hence line-side.                                                                                                 |
| SUPERSTRUCTURE           | A spatial structure element that contains elements that are positioned over the tracks, such as catenaries.                                                                                                                |
| TURNOUTSUPERSTRUCTURE    | The turnout superstructure is one specific type of the track structure. It does not contain any plain-track or dilatation panel.                                                                                           |
