IfcRailTypeEnum.BLADE
=====================
A blade is a machined rail, often of special section, but fixed and/or joined
at the heel end to a rail to provide continuity of wheel support. The two
switch rails in a set are the two inside rails. A switch rail is described as
right or left hand according to whether it is part of a right hand or left
hand half-set of switches.
