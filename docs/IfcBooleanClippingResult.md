IfcBooleanClippingResult
========================
A clipping result is defined as a special subtype of the general
_IfcBooleanResult_. It constrains the operands and the operator of the Boolean
result.  
  
A clipping result is the Boolean difference between a swept solid and a half
space solid, or between the result of the Boolean difference and a half space
solid. Hence more than one difference operation can be applied to achieve the
final Boolean result.
