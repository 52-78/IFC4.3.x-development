IfcDiscretizedPointSet
======================
Class for grouping a set of discretized points. Each point set represents a
track axis alignment. The alignment curve is a non-parameterized space curve
that follows the ordered sequence of discretized points by straight lines (or
splines) between consecutive points. This is an alternative representation the
geometry of any track section described in the parameterized description.
