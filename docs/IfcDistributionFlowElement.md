IfcDistributionFlowElement
==========================
The distribution element
[_IfcDistributionFlowElement_]($element://{8F559036-DE32-4999-B800-D4C2D744B169})
defines occurrence elements of a distribution system that facilitate the
distribution of energy or matter, such as air, water or power.  
EXAMPLE Examples of distribution flow elements are ducts, pipes, wires,
fittings, and equipment.  
HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0.  
IFC4 CHANGE Ports are now primarily defined using
[_IfcRelNests_]($element://{17E0F5E7-BE95-4850-8294-6B964506C1D9}) to enable
definition of ports at type definitions (both forward and backward
compatible), provide a logical order, and reduce the number of relationship
objects needed. The relationship
[_IfcRelConnectsPortToElement_]($element://{BB19D6A5-C718-4ecb-9977-170B771837FC})
is still supported, however is now specific to dynamically connected ports.
