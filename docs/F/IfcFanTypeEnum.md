|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TUBEAXIAL                         | Air flows through the impeller axially with guide vanes and reduced running blade tip clearance.                      |
| CENTRIFUGALAIRFOIL                | Air flows through the impeller radially using blades that are airfoil shaped.                                         |
| CENTRIFUGALFORWARDCURVED          | Air flows through the impeller radially using blades that are forward curved.                                         |
| VANEAXIAL                         | Air flows through the impeller axially with guide vanes and reduced running blade tip clearance.                      |
| CENTRIFUGALRADIAL                 | Air flows through the impeller radially using blades that are uncurved or slightly forward curved.                    |
| CENTRIFUGALBACKWARDINCLINEDCURVED | Air flows through the impeller radially using blades that are backward curved.                                        |
| PROPELLORAXIAL                    | Air flows through the impeller axially and small hub-to-tip ratio impeller mounted in an orifice plate or inlet ring. |
