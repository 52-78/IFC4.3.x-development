IfcFurnishingElement
====================
A furnishing element is a generalization of all furniture related objects.
Furnishing objects are characterized as being  
  
* pre-manufactured and assembled on-site, or  
* manufactured on-site (built-in)  
  
Thus furnishing elements can either be movable, or not (as the built-ins).
