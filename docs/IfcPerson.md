=========
This entity represents an individual human being.  
  
> NOTE  Many countries have legislation concerning the identification of
> individual persons within databases. Although the intent of the IFC Model is
> to act as a specification for data exchange and sharing, an IFC file might
> in some situations be considered to be a database that enables
> identification of a particular person under the terms of such legislation.
> Users should be aware of the constraints of legislation that might apply in
> the places where IFC files are used.  
  
> NOTE  Entity adapted from **person** defined in ISO 10303-41.  
  
> HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.5.1.
