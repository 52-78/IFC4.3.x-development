IfcFlowSegmentType
==================
The element type
[_IfcFlowSegmentType_]($element://{E7B4C0E7-9ED2-4c9a-8710-96F49245E87B})
defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow segment
and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow
segment specification (the specific product information, that is common to all
occurrences of that product type).  
A flow segment type is used to define the common properties of a flow segment
that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow segment is a
section of a distribution system, such as a duct, pipe, or conduit, that
typically has only two ports. Flow segment types (or the instantiable
subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.  
Occurrences of the
[_IfcFlowSegmentType_]($element://{E7B4C0E7-9ED2-4c9a-8710-96F49245E87B}) are
represented by instances of
[_IfcFlowSegment_]($element://{E497EE91-2C62-49ca-9DE4-94F5DF8C2BBE}) or its
subtypes.
