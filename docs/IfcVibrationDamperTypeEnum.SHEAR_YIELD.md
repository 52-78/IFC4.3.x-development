IfcVibrationDamperTypeEnum.SHEAR_YIELD
======================================
A displacement dependent type damper in which the resistance force generated
is determined by the plastic strain amount utilizing the plastic deformation
of the steel material. The shear yield type is a damper, which causes the
steel material to yield for deformation in the direction perpendicular to the
member.
