IfcAnnotationTypeEnum.NON_PHYSICAL_SIGNAL
=========================================
A virtual or fictitious signal. As opposed to the physical signal, the non-
physical signal does not need to send information to the train. E.g. a
fictitious signal on the signalman's display needed to define the route exit
towards open line where there's no real signal. A virtual ERTMS L2 signal is
also a non-physical signal but can have a physical presence, i.e. a stop
marker board along the track.
