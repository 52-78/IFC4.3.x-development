| COMPENSATOR    | A device that is used to fix or adjust the parameter of electric energy, such as voltage loss, power factor and so on.                                                                                                                  |
| CAPACITOR      | A device that stores electric charge when an external power supply is present using the electrical property of capacitance. Two-terminal device characterized essentially by its capacitance.Note: definition from IEC 60050 151-13-28. |
| INDUCTORBANK   | $                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| INDUCTOR       | A device used in circuits or power systems due to their inductance, acting as a component of electric storage device.                                                                                                                   |
| UPS            | A device that provides a time limited alternative source of power supply in the event of failure of the main supply.                                                                                                                    |
| HARMONICFILTER | A device that constantly injects currents that precisely correspond to the harmonic components drawn by the load.                                                                                                                       |
| RECHARGER      | A recharger or battery charger is a device used to put energy into a secondary cell or rechargeable battery by forcing an electric current through it.                                                                                  |
| CAPACITORBANK  | A device that stores electrical energy when an external power supply is present using the electrical property of capacitance.                                                                                                           |
| BATTERY        | A device for storing energy in chemical form so that it can be released as electrical energy.                                                                                                                                           |
