| ENGINEGENERATOR | Electrical generator with a fuel-driven engine, for example a diesel-driven emergency power supply.                                                                                                                 |
| CHP             | Combined heat and power supply, used not only as a source of electric energy but also as a heating source for the building. It may therefore be not only part of an electrical system but also of a heating system. |
| STANDALONE      | Electrical generator which does not include its source of kinetic energy, that is, a motor, engine, or turbine are all modeled separately.                                                                          |
