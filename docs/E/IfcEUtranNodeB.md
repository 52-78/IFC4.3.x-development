IfcEUtranNodeB
==============
An eNB is a logical network component which serves one or more E-UTRAN cells.  
It is the hardware connected to the EPC (Evolved Packet Core), more
specifically to the MME (Mobility Management Entity), which communicates
directly with UEs (User Equipment) in wireless way.  
On the basis of the original functions of Node B, eNB added the physical
layer, MAC layer, RRC, scheduling, access control, load bearing control,
mobility management and wireless resource management of adjacent cells of RNC,
providing functions equivalent to the original RLC/MAC/PHY and RRC layer.
