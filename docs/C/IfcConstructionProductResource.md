> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2.0. Renamed from IfcProductResource in IFC2x.  
  
Occurrences of _IfcConstructionProductResource_ are usage of products to
assist the process of construction. More specifically, they are usage of
products that result from some construction processes and that are then used
as resources to facilitate further construction. For instance, formworks can
be instantiated as products resulting from the process constructing
formwork. However, they are used as resources in the process pouring
concrete in a later stage of the project.
