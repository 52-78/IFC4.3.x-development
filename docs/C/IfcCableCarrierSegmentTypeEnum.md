| CABLELADDERSEGMENT   | An open carrier segment on which cables are carried on a ladder structure.                                                                 |
| CABLEBRACKET         | A cable bracket is a horizontal cable support fixed at one end only, spaced at intervals, on which cables rest.                            |
| CABLETRAYSEGMENT     | A (typically) open carrier segment onto which cables are laid.                                                                             |
| CONDUITSEGMENT       | An enclosed tubular carrier segment through which cables are pulled.                                                                       |
| CABLETRUNKINGSEGMENT | An enclosed carrier segment with one or more compartments into which cables are placed.                                                    |
| DROPPER              | A dropper is a cable carrier used to suspend cable from another cable. It could also conduct electricity.                                  |
