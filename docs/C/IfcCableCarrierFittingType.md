IfcCableCarrierFittingType
==========================
The flow fitting type **IfcCableCarrierFittingType** defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of cable carrier fittings. The set of shared
information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a cable carrier fitting type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcCableCarrierFittingType** may be declared within _IfcProject_
or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcCableCarrierFittingType**
are represented by instances of _IfcCableCarrierFitting_. Refer to the
documentation at _IfcCableCarrierFitting_ for supported property sets,
materials, composition, and ports.
