|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DYNAMIC             | The pressure of refrigerant vapor is increased by a continuous transfer of angular momentum from a rotating member to the vapor followed by conversion of this momentum into static pressure.                                |
| SCROLL              | Positive-displacement compressor using two inter-fitting, spiral-shaped scroll members.                                                                                                                                      |
| RECIPROCATING       | Positive-displacement compressor using a piston driven by a connecting rod from a crankshaft.                                                                                                                                |
| HERMETIC            | Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the motor and compressor are contained within the same housing, with the motor shaft integral with the compressor crankshaft and the motor in contact with refrigerant. |
| SEMIHERMETIC        | Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the hermetic compressors use bolted construction amenable to field repair.                                                                                              |
| OPENTYPE            | Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the shaft extends through a seal in the crankcase for an external drive.                                                                                                |
| TROCHOIDAL          | Positive-displacement compressor using a rolling motion of one circle outside or inside the circumference of a basic circle and produce either epitrochoids or hypotrochoids.                                                |
| BOOSTER             | Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where pressure is increased by a booster.                                                                                                                                     |
| SINGLESTAGE         | Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where vapor is compressed in a single stage.                                                                                                                                  |
| TWINSCREW           | Positive-displacement rotary compressor using two mating helically grooved rotors, male (lobes) and female (flutes) in a stationary housing with inlet and outlet gas ports.                                                 |
| ROTARY              | Positive-displacement compressor using a roller or rotor device.                                                                                                                                                             |
| ROTARYVANE          | Positive-displacement rotary compressor using a roller mounted on the eccentric of a shaft with multiple vanes in the nontotating cylindrical housing.                                                                       |
| WELDEDSHELLHERMETIC | Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the motor compressor is mounted inside a steel shell, which, in turn is sealed by welding.                                                                              |
