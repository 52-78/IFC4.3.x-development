| ROOFING       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| MEMBRANE      | An impervious layer that could be used for e.g. roof covering (below tiling - that may be known as sarking etc.) or as a damp proof course membrane; also, waterproofing material on a bridge structure (typically on top of bridge slab). |
| SKIRTINGBOARD | The covering is used to represent a skirting board being a strip of material to cover the transition between the wall cladding and the flooring.                                                                                           |
| CEILING       | The covering is used torepresent a ceiling.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| COPING        | A protective capping or covering of a wall or a parapet.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| CLADDING      | The covering is used to represent a cladding.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| WRAPPING      | The covering is used for wrapping particularly of distribution elements using tape.                                                                                                                                                        |
| MOLDING       | The covering is used to represent a molding being a strip of material to cover the transition of surfaces (often between wall cladding and ceiling).                                                                                       |
| SLEEVING      | The covering is used to isolate a distribution element from a space in which it is contained.                                                                                                                                              |
| FLOORING      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| INSULATION    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
