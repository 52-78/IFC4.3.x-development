IfcCivilElementType
===================
An [_IfcCivilElementType_]($element://{C17898FE-C0F7-4ac8-888E-98B4D1DCC85A})
is used to define an element specification of an element used within civil
engineering works. Civil element types include for different types of element
that may be used to represent information for construction works external to a
building.
[_IfcCivilElementType_]($element://{C17898FE-C0F7-4ac8-888E-98B4D1DCC85A})'s
may include:  

  

  * linear elements such as sections of a roadway (including carriageway/pavement, verge, median, marker line, kerb etc.);
  

  * elements for connections and junctions including traffic roundabouts, T junctions, 4 way junctions;
  

  * elements for supporting structures such as piers, piles, pylons, and similar.
  

  
The specification of the specific types is provided by the inherited attribute
[_IfcElementType_]($element://{1878049C-B4C6-455f-B606-6C2FFCDABEAD}).ElementType
given as an [_IfcLabel_]($element://{69E7FA5D-0591-4957-9D44-958285900F10}).  
NOTE This is due to the range of choices of element type that are available
and their expression in different languages. It is not considered possible to
create a reasonably full list of types within an enumeration. It is suggested
that selection of the relevant type be drawn from an available ''feature
catalogue''.  
NOTE The
[_IfcCivilElementType_]($element://{C17898FE-C0F7-4ac8-888E-98B4D1DCC85A}) has
been introduced as a stub for future extensions of this specification to
include an object model for civil engineering works.
