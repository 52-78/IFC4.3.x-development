IfcCurveSegment2D
=================
The abstract definition of a bounded 2D curve representation item. Each curve
segment is defined by a start point, a start direction, a segment length and
additional curve geometry parameter. It defines arcs without the need to use a
trimmed curve.  
  
> NOTE  Such 2D curves are used in particular by horizontal alignment
> segments.
