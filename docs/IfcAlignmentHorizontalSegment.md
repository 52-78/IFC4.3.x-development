IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment
=============================
Geometric segments are used to define the horizontal alignment. The segments
are ordered. Each horizontal segment is defined with:  

  

  * a starting point known by its cartesian coordinates
  

  * the starting direction in form of an azimuth [gon] or alternatively [rad](radiant).
  

  * the segment length in [m]
  

  * the information on how the segment is connected to the following segment. This information is used to describe possible discontinuities (e.g. if there is a horizontal bend).
  

  
Additionally:  

  

  * a radius, for arc segments
  

  * an initial and final radius for transition segments as well as the type of transition curve. Some transition curves require additional parameters.
