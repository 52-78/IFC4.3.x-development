IfcDirection
============
The _IfcDirection_ provides a direction in two or three dimensional space
depending on the number of _DirectionRatio_''s provided. The _IfcDirection_
does not imply a vector length, and the direction ratios does not have to be
normalized.

> This entity defines a general direction vector in two or three dimensional
> space. The actual magnitudes of the components have no effect upon the
> direction being defined, only the ratios X:Y:Z or X:Y are significant.  
  
> NOTE  The components of this entity are not normalized. If a unit vector is
> required it should be normalized before use.  
  
> NOTE  Entity adapted from **direction** defined in ISO 10303-42.
