IfcCurrentTransformer
=====================
An instrument transformer in which the secondary current, in normal conditions
of use, is substantially proportional to the primary current and differs in
phase from it by an angle which is approximately zero for an appropriate
direction of the connections.(IEC 60050-321-02-01)
