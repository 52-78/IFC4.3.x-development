IfcGeoslice
===========
Representation of the concept of a sectional planar geological and
geotechnical model, usually an interpretation but sometimes created direct
from ground penetrating measurement. The assembly may contain one of more
strata and anthropic elements. The contained subtypes of
[_IfcGeotechnicalStratum_]($element://{FAEFB134-3800-4995-B222-B921D7E287BF})
will have shape representations made from polygons reflecting the visible
section or poly lines if a 'Yabuki' top surface model is being used.
