IfcCivilElement
===============
An [_IfcCivilElement_]($element://{D6AE4F59-0C81-4205-B42E-A767D56859D0}) is a
generalization of all elements within a civil engineering works that cannot be
represented as BuildingElements, DistributionElements or GeographicElements.
Depending on the context of the construction project, included building work,
such as buildings or factories, are represented as a collection of
[_IfcBuiltElement_]($element://{8ED417F7-860C-4172-9660-46F4EB8D97F3})'s,
distribution systems, such as piping or drainage, are represented as a
collection of
[_IfcDistributionElement_]($element://{D6FBAB6B-EDC4-4561-883E-6AD51D97F2F1})'s,
and other geographic elements, such as trees, light posts, traffic signs etc.
are represented as
[_IfcGeographicElement_]($element://{EF7F45B3-90C4-418c-A001-D9E0534BFFEF})'s.  
NOTE The
[_IfcCivilElement_]($element://{D6AE4F59-0C81-4205-B42E-A767D56859D0}) has
been introduced as a stub for future extensions of this specification to
include an object model for civil engineering works.  
Civil elements are typically horizontally organized using a spatial structure
expressed by spatial zones, therefore
[_IfcCivilElement_]($element://{D6AE4F59-0C81-4205-B42E-A767D56859D0}) is
spatially contained by default within an
[_IfcSpatialZone_]($element://{C6BFC05D-09D4-4bed-92A9-1823739DE0C8}).
