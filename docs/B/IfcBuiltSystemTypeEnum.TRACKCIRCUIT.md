IfcBuiltSystemTypeEnum.TRACKCIRCUIT
===================================
A track circuit is an electric circuit of which the rails of a track section
form a part, with usually a source of current connected at one end and a
detection device at the other end for detecting whether this track section is
clear or occupied by a vehicle. In a continuous signalling system, the track
circuit can be used to transmit information between the ground and the train.  
Note: definition from IEC 60050-82.
