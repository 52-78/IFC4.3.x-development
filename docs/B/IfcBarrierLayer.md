IfcBarrierLayer
===============
Prevents water penetration.  
Prevents pumping and mixing of the layers.  
Protects groundwater in the event of an accident (oil, etc.).  
Guides water to the drainage system.  
The barrier layer prevents the penetration of water into the substructure and
subsoil, restricts the growth of plants, protects the groundwater and reduces
the effects of an accident (e.g. oil spill). It directs the surface water from
the load area to the side of the track, where it can be seeped or drained in a
controlled manner. It is usually placed on a levelling layer of asphalt
granulate.
