| DISK        | A disk bearing consist of an elastomeric disc between two metal plates.                                                                                                                                             |
| POT         | A bearing which carries vertical load by compression of an (elastomeric) disc confined in a (steel) cylinder and which accommodates rotations by deformations of the disc.                                          |
| ELASTOMERIC | A pad bearing which carries vertical load by contact stresses between a sheet of sliding material and a mating surface that permits movements by sliding and accommodates rotation by deformation of the elastomer. |
| GUIDE       | A bearing that ensures that the structure maintains the correct location or expansion/contraction path and takes no vertical load. Inlcudes also restraint bearings.                                                |
| CYLINDRICAL | The bearing functionality is provided by cylinder in a concave cylinder.                                                                                                                                            |
| ROCKER      | The bearing functionality is provided by a rocker construction. Includes line rocker and point rocker bearings.                                                                                                     |
| SPHERICAL   | The bearing functionality is provided by convex dome in a concave basin.                                                                                                                                            |
| ROLLER      | The bearing functionality is provided by one or more rollers that are placed between two plates.                                                                                                                    |
