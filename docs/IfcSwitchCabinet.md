================
In addition to the incoming and outgoing lines, the switchgear is completely
enclosed by a grounded metal casing.  
Switch cabinets/switchgear contain sensitive electrical, electronic and
mechanical components to perform control, drive, power supply and safety
functions. As a rule, these components are of high quality.  
Switch cabinets consist of the cabinet housing and door and the interior
components (e.g. mounting plates), which generally take the form of drawer
units or are mounted on a panel.
