============
The MSC Server mainly comprises the call control (CC) and mobility control
parts of an MSC.  
An MSC Server and a CS-MGW make up the full functionality of an MSC.  
The MSC Server is responsible for the control of mobile originated and mobile
terminated CC CS Domain calls. It terminates the user-network signalling and
translates it into the relevant network â€“ network signalling. The MSC Server
also contains a VLR to hold the mobile subscriber's service data and CAMEL
related data.
