================
Shading devices are purpose built devices to protect from the sunlight, from
natural light, or screening them from view. Shading devices can form part of
the facade or can be mounted inside the building, they can be fixed or
operable.

> act as shading devices. Those elements however have another primary purpose
> and are defined as _IfcSlab_ or by other subtypes of _IfcBuildingElement_.
