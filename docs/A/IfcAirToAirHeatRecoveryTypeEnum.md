| THERMOSIPHONSEALEDTUBEHEATEXCHANGERS | Sealed systems that consist of an evaporator, a condenser, interconnecting piping, and an intermediate working fluid that is present in both liquid and vapor phases where the evaporator and the condenser are usually at opposite ends of a bundle of straight, individual thermosiphon tubes and the exhaust and supply ducts are adjacent to each other. |
| TWINTOWERENTHALPYRECOVERYLOOPS       | An air-to-liquid, liquid-to-air enthalpy recovery system with a sorbent liquid circulates continuously between supply and exhaust airstreams, alternately contacting both airstreams directly in contactor towers.                                                                                                                                           |
| FIXEDPLATEPARALLELFLOWEXCHANGER      | Heat exchanger with moving parts and alternate layers of plates, separated and sealed from the exhaust and supply air stream passages with primary air entering at secondary air inlet location and exiting at secondary air outlet location.                                                                                                                |
| FIXEDPLATECOUNTERFLOWEXCHANGER       | Heat exchanger with moving parts and alternate layers of plates, separated and sealed from the exhaust and supply air stream passages with primary air entering at secondary air outlet location and exiting at secondary air inlet location.                                                                                                                |

| THERMOSIPHONCOILTYPEHEATEXCHANGERS   | Sealed systems that consist of an evaporator, a condenser, interconnecting piping, and an intermediate working fluid that is present in both liquid and vapor phases where the evaporator and condensor coils are installed independently in the ducts and are interconnected by the working fluid piping.                                                   |
| RUNAROUNDCOILLOOP                    | A typical coil energy recovery loop places extended surface, finned tube water coils in the supply and exhaust airstreams of a building.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
