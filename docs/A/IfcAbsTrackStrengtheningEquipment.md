=================================
Component for increasing the positional stability and functionality of a
sleeper  
Use often depends on topology and line routing  
Main function: Increasing the lateral stability (Often used in low radius
curves in the case of continuous welded rail.)  
Dovetails with ballast  
Improves the transmission of longitudinal forces from the running rail into
the sleeper (e.g. anti creep device)  
Assigned to a sleeper
