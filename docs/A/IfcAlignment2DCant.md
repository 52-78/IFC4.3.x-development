IfcAlignment2DCant
==================
An IfcAlignment2DCant is a lateral inclination profile defined along the
horizontal alignment. All points defined in this profile have two coordinate
values. The first value is the distance along the horizontal alignment, and
the second value is the height relative to the projection of the point along
vertical alignment.
