IfcAlignmentVertical
====================
The vertical alignment is composed of geometric segments with the following
three geometry types:  

  

  * Straight line (= constant gradient)
  

  * Segment arc
  

  * Transition curves
  

  
The tolerance limits for the vertical offset and angle errors (= abrupt change
of the gradient) must be kept to, otherwise the chain will be deemed to be
broken.  
The vertical alignment can either follow the track axis or the lower or the
upper rail.
