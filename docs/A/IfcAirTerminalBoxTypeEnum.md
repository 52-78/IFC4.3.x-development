| Attribute                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| CONSTANTFLOW                    | Terminal box does not include a means to reset the volume automatically to an outside signal such as thermostat.                                                                                   |
| VARIABLEFLOWPRESSUREDEPENDANT   | Terminal box includes a means to reset the volume automatically to a different control point in response to an outside signal such as thermostat: air-flow rate depends on supply pressure.        |
| VARIABLEFLOWPRESSUREINDEPENDANT | Terminal box includes a means to reset the volume automatically to a different control point in response to an outside signal such as thermostat: air-flow rate is independant of supply pressure. |
