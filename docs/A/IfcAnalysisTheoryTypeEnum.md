IfcAnalysisTheoryTypeEnum
=========================
This enumeration is used to distinguish between different types of structural
analysis methods, including first order theory, second order theory (small
deformations), third order theory (large deformations) and the full nonlinear
theory (geometric nonlinearity together with other nonlinearities such as
plasticity).
