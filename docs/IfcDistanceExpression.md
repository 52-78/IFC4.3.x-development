IfcDistanceExpression
=====================
An IfcDistanceExpression describes a point relative to a basis curve according
to distance along the basis curve in 3D or as projected onto the horizontal
plane, offset lateral to the basis curve according to the horizontal
orientation at the specified distance, offset vertical to the basis curve, and
an optional additional offset parallel to the basis curve that may be used to
address locations otherwise unreachable where the basis curve is tangentially
discontinuous.
