IfcOutlet
=========
An outlet is a device installed at a point to receive one or more inserted
plugs for electrical power or communications.  
  
Power outlets are commonly connected within a junction box; data outlets may
be directly connected to a wall. For power outlets sharing the same circuit
within a junction box, the ports should indicate the logical wiring
relationship to the enclosing junction box, even though they may be physically
connected to a cable going to another outlet, switch, or fixture.
