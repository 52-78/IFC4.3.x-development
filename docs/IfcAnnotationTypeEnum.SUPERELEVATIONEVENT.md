IfcAnnotationTypeEnum.SUPERELEVATIONEVENT
=========================================
A kind of event that specifies the superelevation (cross slope) at a specific
location along a road alignment, and the type of transition from the previous
location. The locations are specified using an IfcLinearPlacement measured
along the alignment axis curve.  
  
The element(s) that are affected by the superelevation event is currently
proposed to be specified by containing the event in a specific lateral
breakdown element of the road spatial structure (e.g. a Lane).
