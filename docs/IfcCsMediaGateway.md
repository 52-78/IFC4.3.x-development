=================
The CS-MGW is public switched telephone network / public land mobile network
transport termination point for a defined network and interfaces UTRAN
(Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network) with the core network.  
The MSC can be implemented in two different entities: the MSC server, handling
only signalling, and the CS-MGW, handling user's data. An MSC server and a CS-
MGW make up the full functionality of MSC.
