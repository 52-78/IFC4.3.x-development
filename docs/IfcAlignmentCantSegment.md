IfcAlignmentCantSegment
=======================
Geometric segments are used to define the railway cant. The segments are
ordered. Each cant segment is defined with:  

  

  * a starting point known by its distance along the horizontal alignment [m]
  

  * the segment length in [m]
  

  * the start cant value in [mm]
  

  * the end cant value in [mm]
  

  * the information on how the segment is connected to the following segment. This information is used to describe possible discontinuities (e.g. invalid sudden change of cant or missing cant information if end point and starting point differ over a threshold).
  

  
Additionally:  

  

  * an information which describes if a smoothing was applied between two cant segments
