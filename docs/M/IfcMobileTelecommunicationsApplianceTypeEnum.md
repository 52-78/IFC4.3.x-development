| E_UTRAN_NODE_B         | An E-utran nodel B is a logical network component which serves one or more E-utran cells. It is the hardware connected to the evolved packet core (EPC), more specifically to the mobility management entity (MME) , which communicates directly with user equipment in wireless way.                                 |
| REMOTE_RADIO_UNIT      | A remote radio unit is a component of a distributed base transceiver station that converts digital baseband signals into high-frequency (rf) signals and sends high-frequency (rf) signals to the antenna for radiation.                                                                                              |
| ACCESSPOINT            | An access point is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| BASETRANSCEIVERSTATION | A base transceiver station (BTS) is a network component which serves one cell. It completes the conversion between base station controller and wireless channel, and realizes the wireless transmission and related control functions between base station controller and mobile switching through the air interface. |
| REMOTEUNIT             | A remote unit is a device used to amplify a base station signal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| BASEBANDUNIT           | A baseband unit is a component of a distributed base transceiver station for implementing baseband processing functions.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| MASTERUNIT             | A master unit is a component of a repeater for coupling base station signals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
