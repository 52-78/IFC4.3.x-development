IfcMobileSwitchingCenter
========================
The Mobile-services Switching Centre (MSC) constitutes the interface between
the radio system and the fixed networks. It is an exchange which performs all
the switching and signalling functions for mobile station located in a
geographical area designated as the MSC area.  
In order to obtain radio coverage of a given geographical area a number of
base stations are normally required; i.e. each MSC would thus have to
interface several base stations. In addition, several MSCs may be required to
cover a country.
