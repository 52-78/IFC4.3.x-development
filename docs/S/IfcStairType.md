IfcStairType
============
The building element type _IfcStairType_ defines commonly shared information
for occurrences of stairs. The set of shared information may include:  

  

  * common properties with shared property sets
  

  * common representations
  

  * common materials
  

  * common composition of elements
  

  
It is used to define a stair type specification indicating the specific
product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type.
The [_IfcStairType_]($element://{B96BE5EA-C16A-46f5-9FF3-7C0B1882A4AE}) may be
declared within
[_IfcProject_]($element://{261F430C-03B3-4a9e-A414-1452166DEDA0}) or
[_IfcProjectLibrary_]($element://{CA5982C4-A63E-4729-B01F-DD56944575CF}) using
[_IfcRelDeclares_]($element://{2B5611F4-8815-497d-B43E-430F01D3B9F4}) and may
be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of
[_IfcStairType_]($element://{B96BE5EA-C16A-46f5-9FF3-7C0B1882A4AE}) are
represented by instances of
[_IfcStair_]($element://{0337199C-5D07-4169-8EC0-DBBFF9379F50}). Refer to the
documentation at
