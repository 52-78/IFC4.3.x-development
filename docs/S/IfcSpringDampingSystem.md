IfcSpringDampingSystem
======================
Elastic elements are inserted between the superstructure (track and plate on
slab track or ballast bed with ballast inserted in) and the tunnel structure
(tunnel floor). Some of the elastic elements have a partial decoupling effect
between the superstructure and underground due to vibrations. Both helical
springs and elastomer blocks or elastomer strips can be used as suspension
systems.
