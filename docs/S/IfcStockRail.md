IfcStockRail
============
(EN 13232-1-2004)  
fixed machined rail, ensuring the continuity on the main or diverging track
with the switch in the open position. The machined part of the stock rail
supports its switch rail in the closed position, giving continuity of line
through this switch rail. The two stock rails in a set of switches are the two
outside rails. A stock rail is described as right or left hand according to
whether it is part of a right hand or left hand half-set of switches.
