| START_AND_STOP_EQUIPMENT | A switch for alternatively closing and opening one or more electric circuits.                                                                                                                                                             |
| DIMMERSWITCH             | A dimmer switch has variable positions, and may adjust electrical power or other setting (according to the switched port type).                                                                                                           |
| KEYPAD                   | A set of buttons or switches, each potentially applicable to a different device.                                                                                                                                                          |
| MOMENTARYSWITCH          | A momentary switch has no position, and may trigger some action to occur.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| TOGGLESWITCH             | A toggle switch has two positions, and may enable or isolate electrical power or other setting (according to the switched port type).                                                                                                     |
| SELECTORSWITCH           | A selector switch has multiple positions, and may change the source or level of power or other setting (according to the switched port type).                                                                                             |
| STARTER                  | A starter is a switch which in the closed position controls the application of power to an electrical device.                                                                                                                             |
| RELAY                    | A device designed to produce sudden predetermined changes in one or more electric output circuits, when certain conditions are fulfilled in the electric input circuits controlling the device.Note: definition from IEC 60050 151-13-31. |
| SWITCHDISCONNECTOR       | A switch disconnector is a switch which in the open position satisfies the isolating requirements specified for a disconnector.                                                                                                           |
| CONTACTOR                | An electrical device used to control the flow of power in a circuit on or off.                                                                                                                                                            |
