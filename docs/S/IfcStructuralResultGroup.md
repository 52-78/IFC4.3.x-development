IfcStructuralResultGroup
========================
Instances of the entity _IfcStructuralResultGroup_ are used to group results
of structural analysis calculations and to capture the connection to the
underlying basic load group. The basic functionality for grouping inherited
from _IfcGroup_ is used to collect instances from _IfcStructuralReaction_ or
its respective subclasses.
