IfcServiceControlPoint
======================
SCP has the service control function which includes the GSM-R intelligent
network business logic. Through the SSP issued instructions, it completes the
intelligent network business connection and billing control, in order to
achieve some railway specific business.  
At the same time, it also has the service data function, including user data
and network data, for the service control function to extract real-time GSM-R
intelligent network service.  
Together with IP and SSP, it forms an intelligent network subsystem to
separate network switching function from business control function and realize
intelligent control of call.
