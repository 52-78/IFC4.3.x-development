=============
Clamps and fittings provide the mechanical and structural connection of
components and provide electrical connections in contact line systems and
within cross-span structures.They have to withstand both operating currents
and short-circuit current loadsin the energised part of the overhead contact
line system.In addition to the mechanical stresses,short-circuit current loads
occur in the passive part of the overhead contact line system,at rigid and
flexible terminations and also in cross-span equipment.
