=================
Optical pigtail, a subtype of optical fiber cable, is a specific hardware
connection used for cable termination. On a fiber pigtail, one end of the wire
is simply exposed fiber and the other end has a pre-installed connector on it.
Fiber pigtails are commonly spliced onto individual strands of a multi-fiber
trunk cable.
