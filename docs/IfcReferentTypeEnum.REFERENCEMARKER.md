IfcReferentTypeEnum.REFERENCEMARKER
===================================
The reference marker is a notation referent, typically located in the right of
way of the road, rail or other transportation system. Usually reference
markers are initially spaced at a uniform distance along the linear element
being measured, though subsequent re-alignments can result in uneven spacing
between the markers.  
The physical item representing the IfcReferent.REFERENCEMARKER can be an
IfcSign.MARKER (e.g., a bolt fixed on a post)
