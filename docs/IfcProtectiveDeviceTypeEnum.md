IfcProtectiveDeviceTypeEnum
===========================
The _IfcProtectiveDeviceTypeEnum_ specifically defines the range of different
breaker unit types that can be used in conjunction with protective device.
Types may also be used as a reference to a complete protective device in
circumstances where tripping units are not separately identified (typically
expected to be the case during earlier stages of design).  
  
> HISTORY  New type in IFC2x2. Modified definition and usage in IFC4.
