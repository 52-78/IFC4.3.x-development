This enumeration identifies different types of built systems.

## Items

### REINFORCING
System of elements providing reinforcing to the structure.

### MOORING
System of components and elements responsible for keeping or holding an element (a vessel, platform or set of catenary lines) in a desired position.

### OUTERSHELL
System of built elements that provide the outer skin to protect the construction (such as the facade).

### TRACKCIRCUIT
A track circuit is an electric circuit of which the rails of a track section form a part, with usually a source of current connected at one end and a detection device at the other end for detecting whether this track section is clear or occupied by a vehicle. In a continuous signalling system, the track circuit can be used to transmit information between the ground and the train.
Note: definition from IEC 60050-82.

### EROSIONPREVENTION


### FOUNDATION
System of shallow and deep foundation elements that transmit forces to the supporting ground.

### LOADBEARING
System of built elements that transmit forces and stiffen the construction.

### SHADING


### FENESTRATION
System of doors, windows, and other fillings in openings in a built envelope that are designed to permit the passage of air or light.

### TRANSPORT
