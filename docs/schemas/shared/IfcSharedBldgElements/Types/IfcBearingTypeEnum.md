## Items

### CYLINDRICAL
The bearing functionality is provided by cylinder in a concave cylinder.

### SPHERICAL
### ELASTOMERIC
A pad bearing which carries vertical load by contact stresses between a sheet of sliding material and a mating surface that permits movements by sliding and accommodates rotation by deformation of the elastomer.

### POT
A bearing which carries vertical load by compression of an (elastomeric) disc confined in a (steel) cylinder and which accommodates rotations by deformations of the disc.

### GUIDE
### ROCKER
The bearing functionality is provided by a rocker construction. Includes line rocker and point rocker bearings.

### ROLLER
The bearing functionality is provided by one or more rollers that are placed between two plates.

### DISK
A disk bearing consist of an elastomeric disc between two metal plates.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined bearing element.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined bearing element.
