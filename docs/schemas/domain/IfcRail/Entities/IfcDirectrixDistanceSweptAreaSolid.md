# IfcDirectrixDistanceSweptAreaSolid

An abstract entity defining common information about a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping an area along a Directrix. The swept area is provided by a subtype of IfcProfileDef. The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep. The profile normal is  where the profile normal agrees to the tangent of the directrix at this point. The rule of orientation of profileï¿½s x-axis is specialized by the subtypes of IfcDirextrixDistanceSweptAreaSolid.
The start of the sweeping operation is at the StartDistance, provided by _IfcPointByDistanceExpression_. If no StartDistance is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the EndDistance, provided by _IfcPointByDistanceExpression_. If no EndDistance is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix.

## Attributes

### Directrix
The curve used to define the sweeping operation. The solid is generated by sweeping the SELF\IfcSweptAreaSolid.SweptArea along the Directrix.

### StartDistance
Distance expressions indicating the position where the sweeping operation starts along the Directrix. If no distance expression provided the start of the sweeping operation is at the start of the Directrix.

### EndDistance
Distance expressions indicating the position where the sweeping operation ends along the Directrix. If no distance expression provided the end of the sweeping operation is at the end of the Directrix.
