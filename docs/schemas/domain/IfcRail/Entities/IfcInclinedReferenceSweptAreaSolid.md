# IfcInclinedReferenceSweptAreaSolid

An IfcInclinedReferenceSweptAreaSolid is a specialized IfcDirectrixDistanceSweptAreaSolid. The orientation of the profile's x-axis is always follows the rule defined by the IfcAxisLateralInclination.

## Attributes

### FixedAxisVertical
Indicates whether the profile is oriented with its Y axis facing upwards in +Z direction (True), or vertically perpendicular to the Directrix varying according to slope (False).

### Inclinating
The lateral inclination profile which defines the rule for the orientation of the x-axis of the profile in sweeping operation.
