# IfcCompressorTypeEnum

Enumeration defining the typical types of compressors.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New enumeration in IFC2x.

## Items

### DYNAMIC
The pressure of refrigerant vapor is increased by a continuous transfer of angular momentum from a rotating member to the vapor followed by conversion of this momentum into static pressure.

### RECIPROCATING
Positive-displacement compressor using a piston driven by a connecting rod from a crankshaft.

### ROTARY


### SCROLL
Positive-displacement compressor using two inter-fitting, spiral-shaped scroll members.

### TROCHOIDAL


### SINGLESTAGE
Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where vapor is compressed in a single stage.

### BOOSTER
Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where pressure is increased by a booster.

### OPENTYPE
Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the shaft extends through a seal in the crankcase for an external drive.

### HERMETIC
Positive-displacement reciprocating compressor where the motor and compressor are contained within the same housing, with the motor shaft integral with the compressor crankshaft and the motor in contact with refrigerant.

### SEMIHERMETIC


### WELDEDSHELLHERMETIC


### ROLLINGPISTON
Positive-displacement rotary compressor using a roller mounted on the eccentric of a shaft with a single vane in the nonrotating cylindrical housing.

### ROTARYVANE
Positive-displacement rotary compressor using a roller mounted on the eccentric of a shaft with multiple vanes in the nontotating cylindrical housing.

### SINGLESCREW


### TWINSCREW
Positive-displacement rotary compressor using two mating helically grooved rotors, male (lobes) and female (flutes) in a stationary housing with inlet and outlet gas ports.

### USERDEFINED


### NOTDEFINED
Undefined compressor type.
