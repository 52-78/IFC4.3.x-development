IfcFlowTerminalType
===================
The element type
[_IfcFlowTerminalType_]($element://{0150B6A2-B5B8-45b4-9CF6-DD4DF13991E2})
defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow terminal
and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow
terminal specification (the specific product information that is common to all
occurrences of that product type).  
A flow terminal type is used to define the common properties of a flow
terminal that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow terminal
acts as a terminus or beginning element in a distribution system such as a
ceiling register in a ducted air distribution system, a sink in a waste-water
system, or a light fixture in an electrical lighting system. Flow terminal
types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already
assigned to occurrences.  
The occurrences of the
[_IfcFlowTerminalType_]($element://{0150B6A2-B5B8-45b4-9CF6-DD4DF13991E2}) are
represented by instances of
[_IfcFlowTerminal_]($element://{AE61BBF2-82B0-4caf-B137-1EBEB79B2BB6}) or its
subtypes.
