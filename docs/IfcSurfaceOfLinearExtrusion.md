IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion
===========================
The _IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion_ is a surface derived by sweeping a curve
along a vector.  
  
{ .extDef}  
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> This surface is a simple swept surface or a generalized cylinder obtained by
> sweeping a curve in a given direction. The parameterization is as follows
> where the curve has a parameterization λ(_u_):  
>> V = ExtrusionAxis

> The parameterization range for _v_ is -∞ < _v_ < ∞ and for _u_ it is defined
> by the curve parameterization.
