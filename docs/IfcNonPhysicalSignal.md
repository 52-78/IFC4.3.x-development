IfcNonPhysicalSignal
====================
Virtual or fictitious signals. The neutral term "non physical" avoids
confusion among IMs.  
As opposed to the physical signal, the non-physical signal _need not to send
information_ to the train. E.g. a fictitious signal on the signalman's display
needed to define the route exit towards open line where there's no real
signal.  
A virtual ERTMS L2 signal is also a non-physical signal but can have a
physical presence, i.e. a stop marker board along the track.
