IfcDeepFoundation
=================
Deep foundation is a type of foundation that transfers loads deeper than
shallow foundation below the soft soils not capable of bearing the above
structure. Depending on the soil strength it might have to reach down to the
rock layer.  
  
Deep foundation is a new supertype incorporating the existing _IfcPile_ and
the new _IfcCaissonFoundation_.
