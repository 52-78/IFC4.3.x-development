|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FUMEHOODEXHAUST     | Fume hood exhaust damper. Commonly operated by actuator.                                                                                                                                         |
| GRAVITYRELIEFDAMPER | Gravity-relief damper used to allow air to move upon a buildup of enough pressure to overcome the gravitational force exerted upon the damper blades. Commonly operated by gravitational weight. |
| BLASTDAMPER         | Blast damper used to prevent protect occupants and equipment against overpressures resultant of an explosion. Commonly operated by mechanical spring.                                            |
| CONTROLDAMPER       | Control damper used to modulate the flow of air by adjusting the position of the blades. Commonly operated by an actuator of a building automation system.                                       |
| FIRESMOKEDAMPER     | Combination fire and smoke damper used to preven the spread of fire and smoke. Commonly operated by a fusable link and a smoke detector.                                                         |
| RELIEFDAMPER        | Relief damper used to allow air to move upon a buildup of a specified pressure differential. Commonly operated by mechanical spring.                                                             |
| FIREDAMPER          | Fire damper used to prevent the spread of fire for a specified duration. Commonly operated by fusable link that melts above a certain temperature.                                               |
| SMOKEDAMPER         | Smoke damper used to prevent the spread of smoke. Commonly operated by a smoke detector of a building automation system.                                                                         |
| BALANCINGDAMPER     | Backdraft damper used to restrict the movement of air in one direction. Commonly operated by mechanical spring.                                                                                  |
| GRAVITYDAMPER       | Gravity damper closes from the force of gravity. Commonly operated by gravitational weight.                                                                                                      |
| BACKDRAFTDAMPER     | Damper used for purposes of manually balancing pressure differences. Commonly operated by mechanical adjustment.                                                                                 |
