IfcDimensionCount
=================
The _IfcDimensionCount_ defins the dimensionality of the coordinate space. It
is restricted to have the dimensionality of either 1, 2, or 3 for the purpose
of this specification.  
  
> NOTE  The shape representations assigned to a geometric representation
> context may include geometric representation items of lower dimensionality,
> particularly when defining the boundary of planar surfaces as 2D cross
> sections for the purpose of 3D swept areas.
