IfcVibrationDamperTypeEnum.BENDING_YIELD
========================================
A displacement dependent type damper in which the resistance force generated
is determined by the plastic strain amount utilizing the plastic deformation
of the steel material. The bending yield type is a damper, which yields steel
material by bending.
