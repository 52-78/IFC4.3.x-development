IFC4.3.x
========

Repository to collect updates to the IFC4.3 UML schema. The following automated procedures are currently executed on each commit:

* A conversion to the EXPRESS schema language
* An extract of property sets and types to be fed into bsDD
* An extract of documentation strings for the purpose of internationalization
* (Currently disabled: automated diagram generation)

Both schema and tooling are currently under development and do not yet have official status within buildingSMART International.

Place schemas for conversion in the `./schemas/` directory.
